Hello I don't have a Windows machine to test this!

I will test this later on VMs, open a new issue at: https://github.com/guark/guark/issues

Create a new directory in \Program files(x64)\{{ .ID }}, then copy this file content to it.

We will have a windows installer or msi packager for guark windows apps.
