Hello I don't have a Windows machine to test this!

I will test this later on VMs, open a new issue at: https://github.com/guark/guark/issues 

How to install this:

1- Create a new directory in: \Program files(x64)\{{ .ID }} 

2 - Copy this dir content to it.

We will have a windows installer or msi packager for guark windows apps.
